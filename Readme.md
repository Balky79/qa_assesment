# QA ASSESSMENT EXAMPLE

This is intentionally broken/poor API example that is used to assess automation QA candidate.

Do not use in production, ever. Seriously. 

## Installation 


In order to run test application using pipenv:

`pip install --user pipenv`

- setup new pipenv environment in any IDE

or 
pip install 'pandas', 'flask', 'flask_restful' and 'requests' manually, then run server.py script.

Once server is running, use postman collection to perform tests.
